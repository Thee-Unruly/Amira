I’m excited to share that after some intense training sessions and problem-solving, I’ve finally cracked my latest model’s challenge. 🙌 

Meet , our dedicated mental health chatbot. Previously, Amira’s responses were not as accurate as we hoped. For example, she used to interpret 
“What’s mental health?” as 
“I think it’s a mental clinic.” 

Now, she’s much more precise.

For instance, when asked, “What’s a panic attack?” Amira now provides a clear and informative response. It’s been an exciting journey to see these improvements in action.

Next Steps:

1. User Testing: We’ll be conducting comprehensive user testing to refine Amira’s responses based on real-world feedback.
2. Enhanced Training: Leveraging insights to further improve Amira’s accuracy and relevance.
3. Feature Expansion: Developing additional functionalities to address a wider range of mental health inquiries.
4. Partnerships: Exploring collaborations with mental health professionals to validate and enrich Amira’s capabilities
